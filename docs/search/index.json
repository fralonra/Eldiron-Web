[{"content":"Eldiron is currently under active development and a v1 is planned for 2023. Eldiron is open source and licensed under the MIT.\nFeatures of v1  Support games similar to Ultima 4 / 5 or any game which uses a rectangular grid layout. Either render tiles directly or in 2.5D using the built in raycaster. Games can switch between the two modes at runtime or display both at the same time (for example use the tiles view as a mini-map). Eldiron comes with integrated tile-maps or your can use your own square tiles with up to four levels of transparency. Single-player or multi-player experiences. Eldiron has a sophisticated multi-threaded server architecture to allow for as many player or NPC characters as possible. Cross platform. Eldiron is written in Rust and can nearly run everywhere, i.e. on the Web, macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android etc. Eldiron Creator can run on any desktop. A sophisticated behavior node graph makes creation of AI behavior for NPCs easy. The node system is backed by a full-featured scripting language. Eldiron Creator has editors for tile-maps, regions and node based graphs for character behavior, systems (like crafting), items and the overall game logic.  Retro top-down and isometric perspectives as well as low-poly meshes will be supported post v1.\nYou can download the current pre-release in Releases.\nJoin the community on Discord to get in contact.\nGoals  Being able to create games similar to the RPGs of the 80\u0026rsquo;s and 90\u0026rsquo;s. Support single-player or multi-player games and even MMOs. Over time support more perspectives like top-down and isometric.  Eldiron Book I am currently working on the Eldiron Book. Please refer to the book for more detailed information on the creator, the server and clients and the overall project.\nSupporting Eldiron You can support the Eldiron project by becoming a Patreon or a GitHub Sponsor.\n","date":"2022-10-01T00:00:00Z","image":"https://eldiron.com/p/about-eldiron/featured_huf537a5110615a0f1dc353f9aefaa462f_60577_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://eldiron.com/p/about-eldiron/","title":"About Eldiron"},{"content":"The region editor now has a preview mode which shows all active elements like character / loot instances and lighting.\nThe preview now also works in 3D (although with missing features).\nThe tile layers 1-3 have been renamed to F(loor), W(all) and C(eiling), so if you draw the tiles into the correct layers, regions can be displayed both in 2d and 3d. In 2d the tiles are just draw on top of each other while in 3d they are used for the floor / walls / ceiling.\nThe O(verlay) layer replaces all tiles in 2d and the wall tiles in 3d (to optionally change the map, reveal hidden passages etc).\nThe 3d mode still has missing features, like smooth player / monster movements, ceiling support and more. I will implement them over time.\n","date":"2023-02-04T00:00:00Z","image":"https://eldiron.com/p/region-previews/cover_hu02a58db37cff08132397163f62598171_901637_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://eldiron.com/p/region-previews/","title":"Region Previews"},{"content":"I have now released v0.70, an official pre-release with missing features.
