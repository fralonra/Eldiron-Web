Behavior trees are one of the main mechanics in Eldiron. They consist of a [Behavior Tree](../../nodes/#behavior-tree) node which has up to 3 nodes connected to its bottom terminals (the nodes get executed from the left to right).

You would rename the behavior tree node based on the action this tree implements, like **Look**. You can implement and invent any action your character should execute via behavior trees. See the [nodes](../../nodes/) section or watch my Youtube videos to learn more about the various behavior nodes availabe to you.
