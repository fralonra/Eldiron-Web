[Eldiron](https://eldiron.com) is a cross-platform creator for classic role-playing-games (RPGs). It's main aim is to create games similar to the RPGs of the 80's and 90's but with modern features as well as support for single and multi-player experiences.

Eldiron consists of [Eldiron Creator](../creator/), a desktop application available for macOS, Windows and Linux, and various clients (and a server) which will run the created games on nearly any device.

Eldiron v1.0 is under active development and scheduled for 2023. V1 will be able to create games similar to Ultima 4 and 5 including 3D retro regions and multi-player servers.

Later goals are support for more perspectives (like isometric) and much more.

Eldiron is open source (licensed under the MIT) and 100% free to use.
