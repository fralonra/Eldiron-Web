## Features of v1

* Support games similar to Ultima 4 / 5 or any game which uses a rectangular grid layout.
* Either render tiles directly or in 2.5D using the built in [raycaster](https://github.com/markusmoenig/Raycaster). Games can switch between the two modes at runtime or display both at the same time (for example use the tiles view as a mini-map).
* Eldiron comes with integrated tile-maps or your can use your own square tiles with up to four levels of transparency.
* Single-player or multi-player experiences. Eldiron has a sophisticated multi-threaded server architecture to allow for as many player or NPC characters as possible.
* Cross platform. Eldiron is written in Rust and can nearly run everywhere, i.e. on the Web, macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android etc. Eldiron Creator can run on any desktop.
* A sophisticated behavior node graph makes creation of AI behavior for NPCs easy. The node system is backed by a full-featured scripting language.
* Eldiron Creator has editors for tile-maps, regions and node based graphs for character behavior, systems (like crafting), items and the overall game logic.

Retro top-down and isometric perspectives as well as low-poly meshes will be supported post v1.

You can download the current pre-release in [Releases](https://github.com/markusmoenig/Eldiron/releases).

## Goals

* Being able to create games similar to the RPGs of the 80's and 90's.
* Support single-player or multi-player games and even MMOs.
* Over time support more perspectives like top-down and isometric.
